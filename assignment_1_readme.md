### Notes
- Had trouble with getting any rows to show up on the screen. I think it was an issue with the naming of some of the files or an issue with connecting outlets. I could not resolve the issue, so I scapped the entire project and started all over following the steps carefully again.

- Could not find a way to center the launch screen icon on multiple devices using the 'Add New Constraints' options, so the launch screen logo shifts depending on the device.
